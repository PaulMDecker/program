# Overview


This software allows the user to create a list of people and that contains basic information about those people. This list is stored in the firebase cloud database.

I wrote this software to familiarize myself with how databases work and how to use them.

# Cloud Database

I am using the firebase cloud database.
{Describe the structure of the database that you created.}
firestore is a noSQL document-oriented database. this means that the database has no tables or rows. Instead, it has documents organized in collections with each document containing a set of key-value pairs. This database is designed to store large collections of small documents.

# Development Environment

The tool I used to develop this software is Visual Studeo Code.
I wrote this software with python and used the secrets library, the firebase_admin library, and the pip library.
